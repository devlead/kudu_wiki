The Kudu Console is a tool that gives you both command line and file browser access to your sites, all from the comfort of a web browser.

If you start at the [[root of the Kudu service|Accessing-the-kudu-service]], you'll see a `Diagnostic console` link that leads to the Kudu Console.

Note that there is also a local (non-browser based) client that gives you the same Console functionality. See this [post](http://blog.amitapple.com/post/45675601255/azurewebsiteterminal) for details. The post also has some good information about the Console that also applies to the browser-based version, so please read through.
