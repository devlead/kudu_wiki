## Testing
All tests use xunit, this includes the unit tests and functional tests. 

## Unit tests
To run the unit tests just use build.cmd or use [Test Driven .NET](http://www.testdriven.net/) to run them. They are in `Kudu.Core.Test`.

## Functional tests
Running all functional tests require lots of software to be installed and working on IIS.
* IISNode
* ASP.NET MVC 3
* ASP.NET WebPages 1.0

You can download all of this software using [WebPlatformInstaller](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=255386)
